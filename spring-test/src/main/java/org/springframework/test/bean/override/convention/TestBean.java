 * return type is compatible with the annotated field and which name follows the
 * convention:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>if the annotation's {@link #methodName()} is specified,
 *     look for that one.</li>

 *         <li>starting with the annotated field name</li>
 *         <li>starting with the bean name</li>
 *     </ul>

 *
 * <p>The annotated field's name is interpreted to be the name of the original
 * bean to override, unless the annotation's {@link #name()} is specified.
